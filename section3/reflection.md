## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

Section 3 certainly felt more challenging. It forced me to dig through my resources, experiment with different methods/approaches, and reach out to my peers for help. I was really proud of myself in the end.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Spotify has numerous arrays that the application creates as well as the user. Lists of song plays, 'recently listened to artists', 'recommended for you albums', 'your favorite artists,'etc.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method is a function you can use on a list of elements (or an array). There's dozens of functions, from adding/removing elements, sorting, reversing, calculations, etc.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
 Loops are designed to check conditions and reduce tedious/time consuming work. We'd use a loop in conjunction with an array to obtain or manipulate more complex or specific information. When used alone they can reduplicate, sort, and organize information.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
  Loops are tools used to make computer work easier. They are instructions that tell what the computer what to do over and over again until a goal is met.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
 I don't specific questions as the moment, but I know they will come as I become more familiar with the numerous functions/applications.

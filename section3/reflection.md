## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

*Section 3 certainly felt more challenging. It forced me to dig through my resources, experiment with different methods/approaches, and reach out to my peers for help. I was really proud of myself in the end.*

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

*Spotify creates numerous arrays within the application. These include lists of songs played, 'recently listened to artists', 'recommended for you albums', and 'your favorite artists,' among others.*

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

*An array method is a function you apply to an array to complete the following tasks: add/remove elements, sort, reverse, calculate, etc.*

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

 *Loops are designed to check conditions and reduce tedious/time consuming work. We'd use a loop in conjunction with an array to obtain or manipulate more complex or specific information. When used alone they can reduplicate, sort, and organize information.*

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

  *Loops are tools used to make computers work easier by providing instructions that tell the computer what to do over and over again until a goal is met.*

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

 *I don't have specific questions at the moment, but I know they will come as I become more familiar with the numerous functions/applications.*

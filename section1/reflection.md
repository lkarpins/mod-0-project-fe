## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

*I struggle with asking questions due to bad experiences in college/graduate school. It's never nice to be shamed for asking "stupid" questions. Nowadays, I tend to wait until I'm completely desperate before asking anyone. I know this is something I will need to work on during my time at Turing.*

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

 * *Strings - data in letters or characters (can be numbers too!) as long as enclosed in quotes.*
 * *Boolean - data that is either 'true' or 'false'.*
 * *Number - data that includes all numbers ( includes negatives/decimals)!*

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?;

``` JavaScript
var message = "Hello World!";
console.log(message);

```
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

* *(//) Backslashes for 'single line comments.*
* *(/*) *Backslash + asterisk on both ends of comments if there are multiple lines.*

*Both are used to indicate code comments, which explain what your code does. It helps your future self as well as other collaborators understand your intended code meaning/function, especially after the passing of time.*

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

*A variable is a storage container for a value with a specific data type: a number, a string (words or other characters), or a Boolean (true or false). It allows the computer to easily store and access information.*

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

*Weather.com app; temperature-number, humidity-number, and windSpeed-number.*

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

*Concatenation is putting strings and values together with the (+) symbol to form messages, statements, or information to be logged into the console.*

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

*Amazon welcome page where they greet you by name.
Example:
```JavaScript
var name = 'Lidia';
console.log("Hello," + name);
```

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
*Which is best practice: interpolation or concatenation? Does it matter?*

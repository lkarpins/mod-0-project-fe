## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
/* I struggle with asking questions due to bad experiences in college/graduate school. It's never nice to be shamed for asking 'stupid' questions. Nowadays, I tend to wait until I'm completely desperate before asking anyone. I know this is something I will need to work on during my time at Turing. */
2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
/* Strings - information in letters or characters (can be numbers too!) as long as enclosed in quotes. Boolean - information that is either considered 'true' or 'false'. Number - data that includes all numbers negatives/decimals; large numbers are written without commas!*/

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?;
var message = "Hello World!";
console.log(message);

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// <--Backslashes 'single line'
/* <--Backslash + asterisk 'multiple lines' Both are used to indicate code comments, which are comments explaining what your code does. It helps your future self as well as other collaborators understand your intended code meaning/function, especially after the passing of time. */

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is a value that can be changed. It can be a number, a string of words, a statement. This value is stored in a particular order that helps us talk to the computer.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
Weather.com app; temperature-number, humidity-number, and wind speed-number.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Putting strings together to form sentences, statements, information by using the plus (+) symbol.
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

Amazon welcome pages "Hello, 'Lidia'" "message" + "name"

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
